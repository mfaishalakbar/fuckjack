# FUCK JACK (V2)

### Tired of your AOSP (Android Open Source Project) or LineageOS alike 7.X - 8.x builds failing because JAVA and JAVAC are running out of memory? Well, this is because of the Jack server. If you have less than 16GB of RAM, this is a common issue. Use one of these scripts before compilation and it may save you a few headaches. ###

### How to get it ###
```bash
  git clone git://github.com/mfaishalakbar/fuckjack.git fuckjack
```

### User input dependent script ###
```bash
  cd fuckjack
  cp fuckjack.sh ~/<YOUR AOSP SOURCE DIRECTORY>
  cd <YOUR AOSP SOURCE DIRECTORY>
  ./fuckjack.sh
```
### Automated script (no user input) ###
```bash
  cd fuckjack
  cp auto-fuckjack.sh ~/<YOUR AOSP SOURCE DIRECTORY>
  cd <YOUR AOSP SOURCE DIRECTORY>
  ./auto-fuckjack.sh
 
```
### You may use this script or any part of it in any project without any permission or licensing. ###

### This is no longer a build script. Please use this BEFORE using your own build script or building manually. ###
